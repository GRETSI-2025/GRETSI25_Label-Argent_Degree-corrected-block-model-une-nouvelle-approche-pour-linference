# Degree-Corrected Block Model: A New Approach and Efficient Initialization for Inference


This **Python** code contains the tests conducted for a paper submission for **GRETSI 25**.
We use **OtrisymNMF** as a **degree corrected block model (DCBM)** to detect communities in several benchmark networks, including the LFR benchmark. 
We also demonstrate that our initialization, based on separable NMF, significantly improves the results of classical inference methods for the **DCBM of Karrer and Newman**.

All the tools for OtrisymNMF are available in the Python package **OtrisymNMF**. For Karrer and Newman's DCBM and inference methods, we used the **pysbm** package.
The Karate notebook compares the use of OtrisymNMF and Karrer and Newman's DCBM on the **Karate Club network**.
The other files contain experiments demonstrating that the SVCA initialization significantly improves the results of inference methods.

# Reproduce the results

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Python 3.9** (⚠️ Not compatible with Python 3.10+ because of the package pysbm)
- A virtual environment is recommended.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alexia1305/DCBM_OtrisymNMF.git
cd DCBM_OtrisymNMF
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

```bash
py -3.9 -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate        # on Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 🚀 Run Tests

### Karate Club (Figure 3)

To run the `Karate.ipynb` notebook:

1. Activate your virtual environment.
2. Launch Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the `Karate.ipynb` file from the interface and execute the cells.

### LFR Graphs Tests

Run the script and select the desired value for $mu.

# OtrisymNMF
This package provides implementations of the **Orthogonal Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization** (OtrisymNMF) algorithm  as proposed in the paper:

**Dache, Alexandra, Arnaud Vandaele, and Nicolas Gillis.**  
*"Orthogonal Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization."*  
IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP), 2024.  
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), United States.

The algorithm aims to solve the following optimization problem:

\[
\min_{W \geq 0, S \geq 0} \|X - WSW^T\|_F^2 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad W^TW = I
\]

Where:
- **X** is a given symmetric nonnegative matrix (e.g., adjacency matrix of an undirected graph).
- **W** is a matrix representing the assignment of elements to **r** communities.
- **S** is a central matrix describing interactions between communities.

The **OtrisymNMF** package also includes the **SVCA** algorithm to initialize the inference.
